/*
There may be a possibility that a class may inherit member functions with the same name from two or more base classes, and the derived class may not have functions with the same name as those of its base classes. If the derived class object needs to access one of the same-named member functions of the base classes, it results in ambiguity as it is not clear to the compiler which baseâ€™s class member function should be invoked.
