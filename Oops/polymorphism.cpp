/*
Polymorphism: constitutes of two words poly means many and morph means forms 

basically it means existing in multiple forms
basic understanding example
Real-life example:  A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

Types of Polymorphism
Compile-time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism

// compile time polymorphism
// function overloading
/*
a) Function overloading: When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name but different parameters, these functions are overloaded. The main advantage of function overloading is that it increases the program’s readability. Functions can be overloaded by using different numbers of arguments or by using different types of arguments

b) Operator Overloading: C++ also provides options to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for the string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. When placed between integer operands, a single operator, ‘+,’ adds them and concatenates them when placed between string operands.
